# 🚀 Project Hub

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my personal projects, academic work, and coding experiments. It’s a mix of software development for fun and solutions developed during my studies.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **`python`** 🐍 – Automation scripts, Machine Learning experiments, and various hobby projects.
* **`parallelization`** ⚡ – High-performance computing (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA).
* **`c`** 🕹️ – Low-level programming, logic-based games, and algorithms.
* **`comsol` & `matlab`** 🧪 – Physical simulations and mathematical modeling (mostly academic/lab work).
* **`lab work`** 🔬 – Projects and reports developed during university lab sessions.
* **`summer internship`** 💼 – Contributions and tools from my professional internships.
